# Researching
Things I am looking into right now

## List
### Techonology
#### OS
- Plan 9
  - A more faithful attempt at "Everything is a file" variant of unix
  - Interesting ideas within the realm of distributed computing
- NixOS
  - Linux distro with a functional package manager that preserves previous states
  - Has its own prog lang for configuration
- Gentoo
  - "Build everything yourself" linux
- GoBo Linux
  - Distro of linux that does not respect standard File System Hierarchy
- GNU Guix
  - Like NixOS but with using Scheme prog lang for configuration
- *BSDs
  - Competitor to linux
  - Originators of a lot of good ideas that were ported over to linux
#### Filesystems
- ZFS
  - filesystem that lets you pool together drives like raid
- [BTFS](https://github.com/johang/btfs)
  - Mount a torrent as folder and access content on demand
#### Data Structures
- [Y-Fast trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-fast_trie)
  - data structure for storing integers from a bounded domain
#### Langs
- [Red Lang](https://www.red-lang.org/)
  - Modern Incarnation of REBOL
  - Extremely expressive prog lang
- Haskell
  - Purely functional prog lang
- [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ch-expression-language)
  - NixOS config prog lang
  - Purely functional
  - Declaritive
- [Luna](https://www.luna-lang.org/)
  - Visual prog lang
#### Tools
- [Pijul](https://pijul.org/)
  - Rust-based version control based on the theory of patches
- Wayland
  - Graphics system
  - Competitor to X11
- Glendix
  - Linux port of Plan 9 functionality
### Math
- Homotopical Patch Theory
  - Theory behind pijul
### Computer Science
- [Semi-Thue System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Thue_system)
  - Formal rewriting system
- [Purely functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming)
  - Programming paradigm that treats all computation as mathematical functions
  - Easy to cache computation
